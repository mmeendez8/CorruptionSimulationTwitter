# Corruption Simulation in Social Network


## Introduction

The use of Social Networks as a political tool is a common practice and plays an influential role, specially in young and middle-age people. During las years this practice has become more and more popular until being considered as once of the most important sources of data for election polls. 

In this project we perform an analysis on Twitter data applying techniques that are widely used in Complex Networks theory as the Monte Carlo simulation. Specifically, we focus in the analysis of the relations between politicians through the data we have extracted from the its public API. We performed an Epidemic Spreading simulation over the whole network with the aim of study how corruption evolves and flows in the political atmosphere. Our main goal is being able to start from seed nodes, that are currently imprisoned or involved in some corruption case, until trace a path of influence with other nodes that may be susceptible to commit this offense.
